# Deadlock Stacking for "Vanilla"

This expands on the default items that come stacked with "Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders" (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/deadlock-beltboxes-loaders)

Each sub-group of items can be configured to be stacked or not via the mod settings page.

With the initial release all settings are turned on,  to allow a seamless migration from "Deadlock Stacked Recipes" where I was creating these entities previously.
